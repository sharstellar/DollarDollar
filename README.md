# My Personal Project

## Proposal  

*DollarDollar is an application designed for tracking earnings and expenses.*

Do you struggle with saving money? Or maybe have trouble with adding up your finances? You should try this application
because with **DollarDollar, bookkeeping has never been easier!**

Users can: 
- record income and expenses
- categorize transactions 
- check current savings

I designed this application in hopes to improve my personal finances.
Paying has never been easier with cell phones, but at the same time, monitoring my spending has never been harder.
Often times, I find myself completely unaware of where all my money went. At the end of the day, 
I just want an application that can help me keep track of how much money I have and what I am spending my money on.
